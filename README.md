A paired down LaTeX template 
---

*Please fork and submit PRs if you use this and fix any issues*

Based on https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~dbrosius/LatexThesisTemplate.
The template is not meant to be pretty, it just attempts to fulfill UMD's not so pretty formatting requirements.

# Build

I build with `tectonic` and it works fine. A `latexmk` or `pdflatex` `Makefile would be welcome.

# Known issues

* `thesis.cls` has many unused options, and could be simplified.
